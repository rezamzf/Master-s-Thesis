# Upscaling The Dissolution Process of CO2 into Formation Brine Using OPM-flow simulator
This GitHub repository has been established as an additional resource accompanying my Master's thesis conducted in Autumn 2023. The project's primary objective was to scale up the CO2 dissolution process into brine, recognized as one of the most effective chemical trapping mechanisms in CO2 sequestration procedures.

## Abstract

As global reliance on fossil fuels continues, concerns over carbon dioxide (CO2) emission and its role in global warming is intensifying. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a widely recognized solution to mitigate CO2 emission, involving the capturing of CO2 from the main sources and its underground sequestration. This method can potentially reduce CO2 emission by up to 20%, contributing significantly to the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 2Â°C.

This thesis primarily investigates the CO2 dissolution process into brine within aquifers, which is recognized as the most effective long-term chemical trapping mechanism for CO2 sequestration. The study focuses on upscaling the dissolution process and examining the behavior of key factors such as molecular diffusion and convective mixing. For this analysis, the OPM Flow numerical reservoir simulator, ResInsight, and Python programming language are utilized to run simulation files, visualize results, and analyze data from the simulations.

Our findings highlight the significant impact of grid cell size, permeability, and heterogeneity on the CO2 dissolution process. Key conclusions include the influence of permeability in various layers on the rates of molecular diffusion and convective dissolution, and the role of anisotropy in delaying molecular diffusion and reducing its rate.

Our findings highlight the significant impact of grid cell size (utilized in the simulation), permeability heterogeneity, and anisotropy on the dissolution process.
